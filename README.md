# Mifterm Project

Since the terms of the project were to make any projects based on matrix, I came up with a brilliant idea to create a matrix effect, which includes a matrix. I have been a fan of the film of the Wachowski sisters since childhood. And this was even interesting for me:)

__In order for the code to work, you need to create a folder where you can upload the font that I attached in the project, along itself__

### Short explanation of the code

Perhaps let's get started!

First of all, we need pygame and random models.

The next step is to create the MatrixLetters class, which has 3 methods:
1) __init__ - initialization;
2) draw - drawing letters with matrix effect;
3) run - causes the drawing of letters once.

After that, we create the MatrixApp class, which has 3 methods:
1) __init__ - initialization;
2) draw - used to paint the workspace and bring it to the main screen;
3) run - the main loop in the program. this method gives us an infinite matrix effect. at the same time, it controls the exit event from the matrix

And finally, we will create a condition under which the matrix will be launched. The condition will be met if the file is executable.

### What does the result look like?

Due to technical problems with the laptop, I can't capture the video of the screen. but you can see for yourself.

The Matrix is infinite, so you can admire it as much as you like:)

### And the most important question
What would you choose?
